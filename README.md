# <p align="center"> Who are we? </p>

Belimo is the global market leader in the development, production, and sales of field devices for the energy-efficient control of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems. The focus of our core business is on damper actuators, control valves, sensors and meters. Founded in 1975, the company employs over 2,300 people and has been listed on the Swiss Exchange (SIX) since 1995.

## <p align="center"> Case Introduction: </p>

Belimo is exclusively selling HVAC field devices for controlling the air quality and the thermal energy in the buildings such as control valves, damper actuators and sensors. Many devices come with a free of charge digital ecosystems, including such as a mobile app to interact with devices, e.g. to enable commissioning, and with data streaming capabilities via the Belimo Cloud. Even though we collect data from our devices for the customers (which generates costs for maintenance and hosting), we do not currently monetize data or services .

## <p align="center"> Expected Outcome: </p>

You are being empowered to develop use cases to monetize digital assets within the Belimo Cloud. Create an innovative, data driven business model as a digital service.

### Introduction

Belimo offers devices which are able to send data to the cloud providing transparency into building operation performance with respect to heating, cooling, and ventilation.

While only a limited dataset it provided, you are encourage to think "out-of-the-box". Good ideas depending on additional information are definitly worthwhile to pursue, especially if the "missing" data exists but is not provided.

### Data

Two primary data sources are provided.

1. Timeseries device data which includes physical measurements such as volumetric flow, temperature difference, and power.
2. Cloud api interaction logs.g

### Data Access

Teams working on the Belimo case will recieve [Delta Sharing](https://delta.io/sharing/) access via a token. The [Databrick Community Edition](https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html) provides compute and makes use of notebooks. Documentation (in particulare for Spark) to connect to the share is available [here](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/delta-sharing/read-data-open).
